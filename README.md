1. Clone the repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Continuous-Threat-Detection-Windows.git

2. Edit the script (optional)
Open the threat-detection.ps1 file and modify it to include any custom patterns, keywords, or events you want to monitor.

3. Run the script
You can run the script manually from PowerShell:
.\threat-detection.ps1
The script will start monitoring Windows Event Logs for any suspicious activity or patterns that match the detection criteria.

4. Continuous Monitoring
Once the script is running, it will continuously check for suspicious activities and notify you when something unusual is detected. To keep it running, you can leave the PowerShell window open or run it in the background using an appropriate method like Start-Process.

Example of running in the background:
Start-Process powershell -ArgumentList "-NoExit -File C:\path\to\threat-detection.ps1"

5. Log Output
The script generates logs of detected threats and activities. These logs can be saved to a file for further analysis, for example:
C:\ThreatDetection\logs\log.txt

Example Log Output
When a potential threat is detected, the log file will include entries like:
[INFO] 2025-02-18 14:30:12 - No threats detected.
[ALERT] 2025-02-18 14:35:20 - Suspicious login attempt detected from IP: 192.168.1.100
[ALERT] 2025-02-18 14:40:45 - Potential privilege escalation attempt detected in Event ID: 4672
